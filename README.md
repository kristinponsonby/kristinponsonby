## ✨ Hey! I'm Kristin! ✨

I'm a full stack software engineer and fierce advocate for women in STEM. I completed the Flatiron School intensive 10 month bootcamp program for SE in 2021. I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails and HTML/CSS. My diverse proessional background includes Web Development, UX Design, Real Estate, and Digital Marketing. 

I am both left brained and right brained. I love both art and science (specifically where the two intersect). I am analytical, systematic, and tenacious in my approach to problem solving. I pride myself on my ability to communicate directly but with kindness. I demonstrate a meticulous attention to detail in everything I do. I can negotiate and de-escalate a sitaution. I am a professional Googler. Adept communicator. Most importantly, I try to spread positivity every where I go and with everyone I meet.
